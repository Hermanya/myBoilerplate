Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
bower install
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed. If you don't have bower,
`npm install -g bower`.

The above steps will download all the required software to
build and run this app, such as [grunt](http://gruntjs.com),
[requirejs](http://requirejs.org), and [jquery](http://jquery.com).
